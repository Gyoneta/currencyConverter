# currencyConverter
Select both the currency you want to convert and the one to be converted to

1 - There are few currencies to convert to, so there's a need to add the currencies to convert and be converted to (in the array)

2 - The actual price for each currency was set on a specific date and is not somewhat updated automatically (which reminds me that i need to learn how to get the prices as the 
js loads)
